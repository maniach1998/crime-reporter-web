I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.

## Instructions

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required to run this project. 

The project contains two different Node.js project that need to be run at the same time, one in /backend and one in /frontend. First run `npm install` in both,
then run `npm start` in each folder. (Again, both need to be running at the same time). Frontend runs on port 3000, and backend runs on port 4000.

The site should automatically launch in a web browser, but if it doesn't navigate to http://localhost:3000.
